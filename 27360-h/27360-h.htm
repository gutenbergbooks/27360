<h1>PUNCH,<br /> OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>Vol. 147</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><span class="sc">September 9, 1914.</span></h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>The <i>Deutsche Tageszeitung</i> says:&mdash;"Our
present war with England shall
not be done by halves; it is no war to
be stopped by 'notice,' but by a proper
settlement. Otherwise the peace we
all desire would be both rotten and
dangerous." Your wish shall be
respected, <i>Deutsche Tageszeitung</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fines which Germany has been
imposing so lavishly on towns and
provinces will, a commercial friend
informs us, ultimately prove
to be what are known in City
circles as "temporary loans."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, <i>The Globe</i> tells
us that the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> was once
known to his English relatives
as "The Tin Soldier."
In view of his passion for
raising tin by these predatory
methods this title might
be revived.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The German threat that
they will make "<i>Gurken-salad</i>"
of the Goorkhas,
leaves these cheery little
sportsmen undismayed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We give the rumour for
what it is worth. It is said
that, overcome with remorse
at the work of his vandals
at Louvain, the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> has
promised when the war is
over to present the city with
a colossal monument of himself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Meanwhile President <span class="sc">Wilson</span>
is being urged by innumerable
tourist agencies
in his country to stop the
war before any more historical
buildings are demolished.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A number of the more valuable of
the pictures in the Louvre have, with
a view to their safety, been placed in
cellars. <i>La Gioconda</i> is to be interned
at an extra depth, as being peculiarly
liable to be run away with.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Strangely enough, the most heroic
single-handed feat of the war seems
only to have been reported in one paper,
<i>The Express</i>. We refer to the following
announcement:&mdash;</p>

<center>"AUSTRIAN WARSHIP SUNK<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By <span class="sc">J. A. Sinclair Pooley</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Express</i> Correspondent."</span>
</center>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is stated that the German barque
<i>Excelsior</i>, bound for Bremen with a
valuable cargo, has been captured by
one of our cruisers. It speaks well for
the restraint of our Navy that, with so
tempting a name, she was not blown up.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A proposal has been made in <i>The
Globe</i> that all "alien enemies" in this
country shall be confined within compounds
until the end of the War.
Suggested alteration in the National
Anthem: "Compound his enemies."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Carry on" is no doubt an admirable
motto for these times, but the Special
Constable who was surprised by his
wife while carrying on with a cook
(which he thought to be part of his
professional duty) complains that it is
misleading.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We hear that some of our Nuts
have volunteered to serve as regimental
pets.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Partridge shooting began last week,
but poor sport is recorded. The birds
declare that it is not their fault. They
turned up in large numbers, but there
were not enough guns to make it worth
while.</p>

<h2>A BRUSH WITH THE ENEMY.</h2>

<p>"I think we may advance to attack," said the Prussian
Commander, folding up the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> War
Map.</p>

<p>"One moment, Sir," interposed the Chief of Staff,
"the supply of captured alien women and children is
exhausted."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Commander, "we shall be forced to
confront the enemy's fire without the usual screen."</p>

<p>"Why not advance under a flag of truce?" suggested the
Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>"I am loth to violate the canons of civilized warfare,"
said the Commander, "but really there seems no other way,
unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash; Here! Hand me a telegram form. I
have an idea."</p>

<p>The Commander wrote rapidly for a minute. "Send this
at once," he said, "and pre-pay the reply."</p>

<p>In an hour the answer arrived. The Commander tore it
open with eager haste. "We are saved!" he cried. "The
advance commences at daybreak to-morrow." He tossed
the telegram over to the Chief of Staff, who read:&mdash;"Am
forwarding immediately per special train 1,000 foxes as
requested.&mdash;Hagenbeck, Hamburg."</p>

<p>And the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>, reading the Commander's despatch later
in the day, mailed his Super-strategist the insignia of the
Order of the Double-faced Vulture.</p>

<hr />

<h2>DIARY OF A KAISER.</h2>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;To-day has witnessed another triumph for the
high-souled German army. Ten Belgian villages have
been burnt. Some of the inhabitants have been also burnt;
the rest have been driven out to starve. This will teach
Belgium not to build villages in the way of a possible
German advance. General von Schweinehund was in command
of the noble German column. Have telegraphed my
supreme congratulations and have conferred upon him the
Iron Cross. How splendidly God is behaving in these days.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;It is stated that in East Prussia a village has
been burnt by the Russians during a battle. This is
monstrous, and must be stopped at once. Have sent a
protest to the <span class="sc">Tsar</span> and have telegraphed to neutral
countries pointing out that Russia is spreading barbarism,
whereas Germany is spreading civilisation and culture.
A reply has come from America; it contained only one
word&mdash;"Louvain." That may be meant for humour, but
I do not understand it. The Americans must not forget
that Louvain was burnt by <i>German</i> troops, and that being
so there can be no complaint. Have told my Court Chaplain,
Dr. Meuchler, to draw the Divine attention to this infamy
on the part of the Russian Huns.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Six Belgian mayors and five hundred selected
Belgian villagers have been shot by my gallant troops.
One of them had sneered at Lieutenant von Blutgierig as he
sat at breakfast. The Belgians are indeed a stiff-necked race,
but with God's help they shall be made to understand the
sympathetic gentleness of the German character. But to
sneer at a man in uniform is an inconceivable crime worthy
only of an Englishman. The lieutenant has had to go into
hospital to recover from this shameful treatment. He is
a true German and shall be rewarded.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Ordered three cathedrals to be razed to the
ground. Forget how many ordinary churches have been
destroyed. All Belgian and French universities are to be
at once bombarded and burnt for failing to recognise
superiority of German intellect. Have just read noble
book by Professor Lumpenthor, who proves that <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar,
Hannibal, Alexander, Homer, Virgil, Shakspeare,
Napoleon, Attila</span> and <span class="sc">Genghis Khan</span> were all Germans.
He seems to fear that we modern Germans are too merciful.
This is no doubt true, for the Belgians are not yet reconciled
to us as their God-appointed masters.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Our wonderful navy continues its magnificent
deeds. Two Danish boats and an English trawler have
been sent to the bottom by mines in the North Sea. Have
commanded religious services to be held in all German
churches to thank God for all His mercies.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Have arranged everything with Turks, who will
shortly intervene with their army to help Germany to
spread civilisation and the Gospel. Hear that England is
about to use Indian troops. This, being an attack on
German culture, cannot be allowed. Unless something is
done about it shall countermand religious services.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Have ordered all remaining Belgian villages
to be burnt and inhabitants to be shot. This will please
my glorious troops. The Divine blessing is evidently on
our cause.</p>

<h2>HIS FIRST VICTORY.</h2>

<p>"Yes, I like the kit," she said, "and
I'm glad you came to show yourself,
because I've got a little present for
you." He winced.</p>

<p>"I ought to say," he remarked, "that
I have already received five barbed-wire-cutters,
three vacuum flasks, eleven
comforters, six writing blocks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but <i>this</i> won't take up any
room," and she held out a woollen
helmet of the popular colour.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," he replied, drawing
back, "but I never wear them."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," she said;
"they're not meant for tennis tournaments
or the opera, but for the
campaigner whose lodging is on the
cold bare ground. In fact when once
he gets it on he never wants to take it
off again."</p>

<p>"From the look of it," he remarked,
"it will be a case of Hobson's choice.
You've underrated the size."</p>

<p>"I took your measurements last
week," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"But that was before I joined the
colours. You forgot to allow for
subsequent developments."</p>

<p>"In any case the wool stretches,"
she observed. "Are you going to try
it on?"</p>

<p>"It will play the very deuce with my
hair," he objected.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "Dick shall
have it."</p>

<p>"Never," he exclaimed, and snatching
up the woollen object, began to ram his
sleek head into the small aperture at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Halfway through, apparently yielding
to panic, he sought to return to
fresh air and the light of day, but her
hands ruthlessly seized the elaborate
crochet edging, and pulled and tugged
it down mercilessly towards his shoulders
until his distorted features appeared
at the hole in front with a pop, and she
clapped her hands in delight.</p>

<p>"It fits you like a glove," she cried,
"and though your nose is a bit red you
look quite handsome."</p>

<p>"I'm being strangled," he gasped,
clutching at his throat; "take it off!"</p>

<p>"In time of war," she observed, "we
all have to put up with a little inconvenience.
I shall soon be living on
turnips, for instance, and you know
how I hate them."</p>

<p>With a strange gurgling in his throat,
he collapsed on the Chesterfield. His
face grew purple, his eyes bulged and
rolled, his veins swelled, his head
dropped forward. She grew alarmed.</p>

<p>"Are you really choking?" she
exclaimed. "Here, take your hands
away. Let me help! Good gracious!
<i>Darling!</i> Oh! Whatever shall I do?"
She sprang for her scissors, and in a
moment the helmet lay on the carpet
hopelessly mutilated.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he replied, smoothing his
ruffled hair. "In another minute the
Germans would have missed their
billet."</p>

<p>"Neither you nor Dick will be able
to wear it now," she said, and her lip
trembled.</p>

<p>"Dick won't," he said, "and as a
matter of fact I'm going to."</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you?" And there was a
catch in her voice.</p>

<p>"Not on my head perhaps, but on
my heart&mdash;or rather," he added, slipping
a khaki arm round her, "on the place
where my heart used to be."</p>

<p>Next morning, on parade, his chest
measurement was the object of universal
envy.

<h2>THE TWO RECRUITING SERGEANTS.</h2>

<p>Upstairs, Baby, after many false
starts, had finally settled into sleep.
Downstairs, the little maid, alternately
rattling knives against plates and saying
"S'sh" to herself, had cleared away
dinner. John, who had been strangely
silent during the meal, was in his deep
arm-chair, smoking. It was Mary's
peace-hour.</p>

<p>She lay on the sofa, for she was
always tired by now, reading the morning
paper&mdash;her first chance at it. As she
read, she made little comments aloud,
as that the Germans were beasts, or
that it was splendid about the Russians
doing so well; and this was the signal
for John to join in with the latest
strategic gossip from the City.</p>

<p>Only to-night he didn't. He just
sat smoking and thinking ... thinking.</p>

<p>"I suppose the French," said Mary,
lazily, "are going to&mdash;&mdash; John!" She
looked across at him suddenly, realizing
all at once that he had answered
none of her questions, knowing all at
once that something was the matter.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, coming out of his
thoughts with a start.</p>

<p>"John, you&mdash;," she sat up with a
jerk and craned her head forward at
him&mdash;"you haven't been dismissed?"
She clenched her hands tight for the
answer. Sometimes at night, when he
was asleep and she wasn't, she would
wonder what they would do if he were
dismissed.</p>

<p>"Silly, of course not," said John
with a laugh.</p>

<p>She gave a sob of relief and went
over and sat on his knee and put her
arms round his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, John, I was so frightened.
But what is it? There's <i>something</i>."</p>

<p>He smoked rapidly for a little. Then
he put his pipe down, kissed her, and
lifted her off his knee.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," he
said; "but you mustn't look at me or
I couldn't. Sit down there." She
curled herself up on the floor, leaning
back against his knees. "Mary"&mdash;he
swallowed something which had stuck in
his throat&mdash;"Mary, I've got to enlist."</p>

<p>She was round in a flash.</p>

<p>"What do you mean you've got to?"
she cried indignantly. "That beast
going to make you?" The beast was
John's employer, a kindly man, whose
fault it was to regard John as one only
among many, a matter on which Mary
often longed to put him right.</p>

<p>"No," said John. "But&mdash;but I've
got to."</p>

<p>"Who's making you, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know ... I suppose the
<span class="sc">German Emperor</span> really."</p>

<p>"There's lots that ought to go before
<i>you</i> go. You've got a wife and a
child. Let those without go first."</p>

<p>"I know," said John doggedly. "I've
thought of that."</p>

<p>She threw her arms round his neck
in a sudden passion. "You <i>can't</i> leave
me, John, you <i>can't</i>! I couldn't bear
it. Why, we've only been married
eighteen months. How can you want
to go away and leave me and baby
and&mdash;&mdash; Why, you might get killed!"
Her voice went up to a shriek.</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i> to leave you," said
John, a strange, terrifying, rapid-speaking
John; "I hate it. I hate war, I
hate fighting, I hate leaving you&mdash;oh,
my God, how I hate leaving you, my
darling! I've prayed to God all day to
stop the war before I have to go, but of
course He won't. Oh, Mary, <i>help</i> me
to go; don't make it harder for me."</p>

<p>She got off his knee; she brought a
chair up opposite to him; she sat down
in it and rested her chin on her hands
and looked straight at him.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," she said.
"I'm quite all right." So he told her
all about it, and she never took her eyes
off his face.</p>

<p>"A man came into the office to-day
to talk to us about the war. The
Governor introduced him&mdash;Denham, his
name was ... I knew he was all right
at once. You know how you feel that
about some people ... He said he
thought perhaps some of us didn't quite
know what to do, and he wondered if
he could help any of us ... Said of
course he knew that, if we thought
England was in danger, we'd all rush
to enlist, but perhaps we didn't quite
know how much England <i>was</i> in
danger, and all that England stood for&mdash;liberty,
peace, nationality, honour
and so on. In fact he'd come down to
see if any of us would like to fight for
England ... Said he was afraid it was
rather cheek of him to ask us to defend
him, because that was what it came to,
he being too old to fight. Said he knew
some of us would have to make terrible
sacrifices, sacrifices which he wasn't in
the least making himself. Hoped we'd
forgive him. He couldn't say that if
he were as young as us he'd enlist like
a shot, any more than he could say that
if a woman jumped off Waterloo Bridge
on a dark night he'd jump in after
her. On the whole he thought it would
be much easier to pretend he hadn't
noticed. In fact that's very likely
what he <i>would</i> do. But if someone,
say the mother of the girl, pointed out
the body to him, then he'd have to come
to a decision. Well, he was in the
position of that mother, he had come
down to point out the body. He confessed
it wasn't the job he liked best,
pointing out bodies for other people to
save, but he was doing it because he
thought it might be of some service.
That was what we all had to realize,
that it was a time when we had to
do things we didn't like. 'Business
as usual' might be a good motto, but
'Happiness as usual' was a thing we
mustn't expect ..."</p>

<p>John fell into silence again.</p>

<p>"What else did he say?" asked
Mary, still with her eyes fastened on
his face, as though she were looking at
him for the last time.</p>

<p>"That was how he began. I can't
tell you all he said afterwards, but I
felt as if I'd just fight for <i>him</i>, even if
there was nobody else in England ..."</p>

<p>"Aren't there lots of people who
wouldn't mind going as much as you?"
said Mary timidly. "I mean men with
no wives or children. Oughtn't they
to go first?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they ought. But, you
see, you'd never get anywhere like that.
A would wait for B who was married
but had no child, and B would wait for
C who wasn't married but had a
mother, and C would wait for D who
was an orphan, and so on. That's
what Mr. Denham said."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mary miserably.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand what
we're in the world for," said poor
John, "or what the world's for at all.
But I suppose the great thing is that&mdash;that
good ideas should live and bad
ideas should die ... I haven't done
much for good ideas so far, I'm not
the sort of person who could ... just
one out of thousands of others ...
But I could do something for good
ideas out there. I could help beat the
bad idea of War ... Mr. Denham
says if we win there's lots of men, all
the best and cleverest in the country,
who are pledged to see that there shall
be no more war. Well, that's what I
call a good idea ... only we've got to
win first."</p>

<p>"I know it sounds a wretched thing
to say, but what about money?" asked
Mary hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Mother would take you in; there'll
be enough to pay her something. We
might try and let the house."</p>

<p>And then all the memories of summer
evenings and happy Sundays rushed
upon Mary and she broke down.</p>

<p>"Our little garden of which we were
so proud!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"The Belgians," said John sadly,
"were proud of their little gardens."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>So far Recruiting Sergeant Denham.
Meanwhile Recruiting Sergeant Flossie
had also got to work. Flossie, awaked
by the shock of war to the surprising
fact that, after twenty-two years of
vain, idle and inglorious life, she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
now of the most complete unimportance
to her country, had (for the first
time) a sudden longing to "do something."
And so, being unfitted for
needlework, nursing or the kitchen, she
adopted eagerly the suggestion of some
stupid and unimaginative old gentleman,
and constituted herself (under
God) Supreme Arbiter of Men's Consciences
for the South-West Suburbs
of London. Patriotically aglow, she
handed out white feathers to all the
un-uniformed young men she chanced
to meet ... the whitest of all coming
to John, as he made his way next
morning to the recruiting office.</p>

<h2>HOW WILL YOU TAKE IT?</h2>

<p>I sometimes doubt whether my bank
takes me really seriously. Not that it
isn't businesslike. They let me know
to the minute when I have overdrawn
my account by five and elevenpence;
but they cash my cheques with a certain
air of patronage, whereas, if you
look at things properly, the patronage
is all on my side.</p>

<p>Every Saturday morning a man comes
to my bank to cash a cheque for a
hundred and fifty pounds. (How he
gets through all that money in a week
I have never had the courage to ask
him.) Every Saturday morning I come
to my bank to cash a cheque for&mdash;well,
whatever it happens to be, you know.</p>

<p>The trouble is that we nearly always
coincide; only the other man always
seems to coincide first. And, as he
takes his hundred and fifty on a selective
principle, I am beginning to know from
bitter experience what he will ask for
and how long he will take to get
served. He begins with a note for fifty
and goes on with fifty in fivers. Then
he has twenty sovereigns, and so on,
down to the pound in copper. He and
the cashier chat airily the while of
cabbages and kaisers. Then at last he
goes away full, and the cashier turns
to me.</p>

<p>The Saturday before last I ventured
to ask whether, if the hundred-and-fifty
pounder always insisted on arriving
two seconds before me, it wouldn't be
possible to cash my cheque, which
is a simple little thing, in one of the
intervals during which, after sending to
the cellars for more gold, they relapse
into easy conversation; or, alternatively,
if it was really necessary to pay a customer
exactly the complicated bunches
of monies he demanded; and, if so,
whether it couldn't be done any quicker.</p>

<p>The answer proving unsatisfactory
I determined to arrive earlier last
Saturday. I made no mistake. I hung
about the door of the bank for a quarter
of an hour till I saw my rival approach.
I came in just ahead of him, and presented
my cheque. The cashier received
it with his usual little smile and
turned it over. Then his usual little
smile left him and he set sadly to work.</p>

<p>The hundred-and-fifty pound man
chafed and stamped his feet behind me
for ten minutes, while I gloated. It
was my day&mdash;my <i>Tag</i>.</p>

<p>I think you may like to know just in
what shape I demanded the payment of
my modest fifty shillings:&mdash;</p>

<h2>WAR DECLARATIONS.</h2>

<p>"No, I don't mean that at all," said
my wife hastily. "You quite misunderstand
me. Of course everyone is
to have as much, quite as much, food
as he wants."</p>

<p>"Stop a bit. Does that mean as
much as he likes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Or as much as his system requires?"
suggested the Reverend Henry.</p>

<p>"Or as much as he can contain?"
demanded Sinclair. "It may seem to
be a fine point, but I think we ought to
have it cleared up."</p>

<p>The hostess resumed: "Everyone is
to have as much as he likes, certainly.
Of course he is. We are not going to
be inhospitable. On the contrary, we
are prepared to share our last crust.
But there must be absolutely no waste."</p>

<p>There was a short pause. No one
was inclined to demur to that proposition.
The Reverend Henry alone had
doubts.</p>

<p>"It is difficult at a time like this,
you know," he began mildly, "to be
quite certain that you are doing the
right thing. If you stop all waste in
your household are you sure that you
may not be encouraging unemployment?
If you don't waste biscuits it
follows that fewer biscuits are made
and therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry was adjudged
to be on the wrong tack and his protest
was swept aside.</p>

<p>"Breakfast now," my wife began
briskly, bringing into action her block
of notepaper and fountain-pen. "All
that I want to know&mdash;I wouldn't
dream of stinting you&mdash;is&mdash;how much
do you intend to eat?"</p>

<p>She looked round expectantly, the
pen poised in her hand. There was
rather an awkward pause. The question
seemed at first blush a little
indelicate. Sinclair tried to temporize.</p>

<p>"But wait a bit," he said. "Can't
the servants manage to consume&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The servants breakfast long before
you are up, Mr. Sinclair," my wife
reminded him.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly simple," said I, suddenly
taking the floor; "I think it an
admirable idea, the essence of good
citizenship. What we have got to do
is to declare our appetites overnight so
that every man eats the food he has
booked and we make a clean sweep.
Book me for two eggs and a kipper."</p>

<p>"Sorry there are no kippers to-morrow,"
said my wife. "Boiled eggs,
bacon and kidneys and mushrooms."</p>

<p>"It would be wrong to suppose that
I do not consider it a wise and indeed
public-spirited idea in every way," said
the Reverend Henry after some reflection,
"but it is a little difficult, you
know. It depends so much upon how
one sleeps and what one feels like, and
what sort of morning it is, and the
letters that come, and the war news."</p>

<p>"And on the temperature of one's
tub," added Sinclair. "For my part I
eat a lot at breakfast. I don't feel that
I have the face to advertise the whole
catalogue in this sort of way. It's too
cold-blooded. Besides, I fluctuate like
anything."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/220.png">
<img src="images/220.png" width="100%" alt="Let us prey" /></a><br /><br />
<p><i><span class="sc">German Kaiser</span>. "<span class="sc">Let us prey</span>."</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Come on," said I. "You fellows
are simply trying to shirk the thing.
I declare two eggs, no bacon and three
mushrooms, assuming an average size
for mushrooms. One cup and a half
of coffee. Three lumps in all."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a fairly good lead,"
said Sinclair. "I propose to double
you on mushrooms and I should like
to be put down for a kidney. What
about you, Henry?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but one rasher of bacon,
please," said Henry meekly. "I am
never hungry in the morning and I
have always wanted to know how much
bacon there is in a rasher. A single cup
of tea, no sugar, but plenty of cream."</p>

<p>My wife had been writing busily.
Now she looked up. "What about
toast?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> going into details," said
Sinclair approvingly. "Doesn't it
rather depend on the size of the slice?
You may enter me for a couple of
slices, three by two. And jam&mdash;no,
marmalade. An ounce of marmalade."</p>

<p>"Do be quiet while I add it up,"
said my wife, for Sinclair was causing
a lot of confusion by trying to barter a
brace of mushrooms against my second
egg (or at least to hold an option on the
egg) in case he changed his mind before
the morning. "And now I'll just send
this to the kitchen, and then I'll go to
bed."</p>

<p>It never really panned out well. On
the first morning a very awkward thing
happened. My wife, in her zeal to
provide for her guests, had omitted to
count herself in. We had to make a
subscription for her, and it must be
said that a splendid response was forthcoming,
Sinclair nobly renouncing his
kidney. But the result was that lunch
had to be put half-an-hour earlier, and
the day was disorganised.</p>

<p>On the second morning, the Rev.
Henry was down early and bagged all
my toast, while Sinclair, who had slept
badly, refused to meet his obligations
in the matter of kedjeree.</p>

<p>By the third day there was a good
deal of unseemly barter and exchange
going on, and Sinclair made a corner
in eggs. "The trouble is," he explained,
"that you never really know how good
a thing is till you see it. Overnight a
sardine on toast means nothing to me;
and it was never announced that these
eggs were going to be poached."</p>

<p>On the fourth day the scheme was
tottering. Sinclair had actually been
for a walk before breakfast and was
consequently making an unsuccessful
tour of the table in quest of extra toast.
He then looked for the second time
under the little blue blanket that keeps
the eggs warm and peered disconsolately
into the coffee pot. And then
he struck.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall have to chuck
it," he announced. "We mean well,
but it doesn't work."</p>

<p>My wife was a good deal taken aback,
but Sinclair went on to prove his case.</p>

<p>"We are trying to avoid waste," he
said. "Well, we may have eliminated
a certain amount of&mdash;let us say <i>material</i>
waste, but we are causing, on the other
hand, the most deplorable moral waste.
Henry and I were simply not on
speaking terms yesterday after he
scooped my marmalade under my very
nose, and as for Charles" (that is myself)
"he is simply out for loot. He
gets down before the gong. And this
is essentially a time to heal all differences
and stand shoulder to shoulder."</p>

<p>"But I can't have waste," said my
wife, who likes to stick to her point.
"If things are left over there is no
one to eat them."</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure," the
Reverend Henry broke in eagerly, "to
present you with a couple of live pigs&mdash;the
animal kind, I mean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CENSOR HABIT.</h2>

<p>Not the least disastrous circumstance
for which this war must be held responsible
is a certain misunderstanding
arrived at between Phyllis and myself.
Fortunately the sky is clearer now, but
there was a time when the situation
looked extremely ugly.</p>

<p>This is a copy of the letter I received
from Phyllis a few days ago:&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="sc">Dear Jack</span>,&mdash;</p><p>So sorry for you that
you couldn't pass the doctor. Have
just heard from Leo for the first time.
He left &mdash;&mdash; on the &mdash;&mdash;, and after a
satisfactory passage arrived at &mdash;&mdash;.
They entrained soon after and are now
in the neighbourhood of &mdash;&mdash;. What
do you think? The &mdash;&mdash; s have occupied
&mdash;&mdash;. Captain &mdash;&mdash; sends his regards
to you.</p>

<p class="regards">
"Yours, with love,<br />
"<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>I only know one man in the regiment
that Phyllis's brother adorns, and his
name is Captain Nares. Even supposing
that the name had been censored
in Leo's letter, there could be no doubt
as to the identity of the person to whom
the writer referred.</p>

<p>So far as I could see there was one
of two possibilities. Either Phyllis
was involuntarily developing the Censor
habit, or she was treating the exigencies
of correspondence in war-time with a
levity that in a future wife I firmly
deprecated. Humour of this kind is
all very well in its place; but these are
not days in which we must smile without
a serious reason. I determined to
teach her a lesson.</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="sc">Dear Phyllis</span>," I wrote,&mdash;</p><p>"Many
thanks for Captain &mdash;&mdash; 's regards. I
don't remember the name, but possibly
we are acquainted. By the way, you
remember that bracelet you so much
admired in the window in &mdash;&mdash; Street?
I really could not let you go on breaking
the Covet Commandment for ever, so I
bought it yesterday. I don't like sending
it through the post at this critical
time, so if you will meet me at the
corner of &mdash;&mdash; Circus and &mdash;&mdash; Street
at &mdash;&mdash; o'clock, on &mdash;&mdash; night, I will
bring it along.</p>

<p class="regards">
"Yours ever,<br />
"<span class="sc">Jack</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>Knowing her as I do, I thought that
this, if anything, would bring Phyllis
to her senses. On the other hand, she
appeared to look on it as a kind of
challenge, and sent me the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="sc">Dear Jack</span>,&mdash;</p><p>Thanks very much for
your nice thought. But you must have
mistaken the shop. I'll tell you why.
Only this morning I was gazing at the
very bracelet, when who should come up
but &mdash;&mdash;. He's an awfully nice fellow,
and very determined. When I told him
what I was looking at, he actually
suggested buying me the bracelet. Of
course I said that no lady would
dream of accepting a present like that,
but he wouldn't hear of a refusal and
simply pushed the darling thing into
my hand. I am meeting him at the
&mdash;&mdash; 's at luncheon on Friday. So
sorry you won't be there.</p>

<p class="regards">
"Yours ever,<br />
"<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>In reply to which I wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="sc">Dear Phyllis</span>,&mdash;</p><p>You'd better
marry &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p class="regards">
"<span class="sc">Jack</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>Phyllis wrote back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sorry, shan't be able to now. &mdash;&mdash;
has just been called up, and sails from
&mdash;&mdash; for &mdash;&mdash; on &mdash;&mdash;. So perhaps
you and I had better be engaged again.
I'm longing for a bracelet.</p>

<p class="regards">
"<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>There was only one way of answering
this superb piece of impudence. I enclosed
a blank sheet of paper to Phyllis,
signifying my complete indifference.</p>

<p>Her still more negative answer was
an envelope addressed to me with no
enclosure at all.</p>

<p>To this I replied by not replying.</p>

<p>And here, by all the laws of sequence,
our correspondence should have been
brought to a standstill. I calculated,
however, that when the postman delivered
my phantom communication
next morning Phyllis would not remain
twiddling her thumbs for long.</p>

<p>Sure enough, about 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> I received
this wire:</p>

<p>"Regret your letter of apology intercepted
by Censor. Will take same for
granted in consideration of war-time.
All is forgiven. Call here this evening
with bracelet.&mdash;<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>."</p>

<p>It is very fresh and delightful of
Mr. <span class="sc">H. H. Davies</span> to regard seriously
the love of a man for a maid. North
of the river and west of Temple Bar it
is the intrigues of the highly compromised
middle-aged which are supposed
to be most worthy of attention
on the stage. But Mr. <span class="sc">Davies</span> (luckily)
is never afraid of being young. So he
starts us off with a picture of <i>Geoffrey</i>
in the clutches of drink and drugs just
because <i>Valentine</i> has jilted him. True
that when <i>Valentine</i> is finally married
to another man <i>Geoffrey</i> is still in love
with her, and receives her at midnight
in his rooms; but by this time Mr.
<span class="sc">Davies</span> has given us three excellent
Acts in his own best manner.</p>

<p>And these Acts are hardly concerned
with the love of <i>Geoffrey</i> for <i>Valentine</i>
at all, but with the relations between
<i>Geoffrey</i> and <i>Miriam</i>, a woman of the
town. She is, like <i>Geoffrey</i>, an outcast;
but she has all the good qualities which
he lacks, and she is brave and loving
enough to drag him from the pit into
which he was sinking. He rewards
her by chasing after <i>Valentine</i> again
(now tired of her husband)&mdash;and also
by getting Mr. <span class="sc">Davies</span>, as I thought,
a little way out of his element.</p>

<p>The solution of this less common
triangle&mdash;man, mistress, other man's
wife&mdash;I must leave to the author to
reveal to you. Meanwhile I thank him
for an absorbing play, in which the
two chief characters were extremely
well worked out. Perfectly played by
Mr. <span class="sc">Gerald Du Maurier</span> and Miss
<span class="sc">Ethel Levey</span>, they were two very
human people.</p>

<p>By the way, in one respect <i>Outcast</i>
must easily break all records. Never
have so many stage cigarettes been lit
(and thrown away) in the course of an
evening. I wish that somebody who
reads this and is tempted to pay a
visit to Wyndham's would let me
know the full number. I began
counting too late.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>(<span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby</span>, M.P.)</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August
31.</i>&mdash;The peace in the Parliamentary
arena which passed the understanding
of the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> and went far to foil his
plans, is temporarily broken.</p>

<p>Moving adjournment <span class="sc">Premier</span> reminded
House of actual situation concerning
Home Rule Bill and Welsh
Disestablishment Bill. But for the
outbreak of war Parliament would have
been prorogued at least a fortnight
ago and, by automatic procedure under
Parliament Act, these measures would
have been added to Statute Book. On
outbreak of war political parties, amid
plaudits of the Country, patriotically
put aside partisan tactics and presented
a united front to the common foe.</p>

<p>As <span class="sc">Premier</span> reminded House this
afternoon, three weeks ago he declared
desire that no party in any quarter
of the House should gain advantage
or should suffer prejudice from the
temporary suspension of domestic controversy.
When this was resumed,
matters should be taken up and proceeded
with exactly at the point and
under the conditions at which they
were left. The main feature of such
conditions was the avowed intention of
the Government to place the two Bills
on Statute Book, hope being cherished
of arrival at friendly settlement by
means of Amending Bill.</p>

<p>This simple uncontrovertible statement
of familiar facts quietly listened
to. No note of contradiction broke the
silence. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> frankly accepted
the situation as set forth by the <span class="sc">Premier</span>.
Expressed hope that in the
interval between adjournment and resumption
of sittings some means would
be found of avoiding renewal of controversy
which he described as "a
disgrace to the House," adding, amid
general cheers, "The country will not
readily forgive those who are responsible."</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Redmond</span> assumed that if the
proposal to reach a friendly settlement
failed the intention of the Government
to place the two Bills upon the Statute
Book remained in force. This obvious
assumption, based upon reiterated statements
from the Treasury Bench, drew
assenting cheer from Ministerialists.</p>

<p>It was here <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> interfered.
Amid angry interruption he
asked Members opposite to "consider
whether it is possible decently to introduce
subjects of acute political discussion
in the present circumstances."
Lively talk followed, showing that the
bitterness of Home Rule controversy is
not dead or even sleeping.</p>

<p>What might have developed into discreditable
scene of the kind deprecated
by <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> was averted by interposition
Of the <span class="sc">Premier</span>. In gravest
tone, "with all the solemnity I can
command," he besought the House to
bring the discussion to a close.</p>

<p>Appeal irresistible. House turned
to disposal of remaining business, remaining
at work till half-an-hour after
midnight.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Adjourned till Wednesday
in next week.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT ENDOWMENT SCHEME.</h2>

<p>Jane's uncle&mdash;Jane is my daughter&mdash;came
to me one day and said, "What
do you think of my giving Jane a
camera for her birthday? Wouldn't
she be pleased? The advertisement
says, 'Any babe can do it,' and she'll
be ten."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt she'd be delighted,"
I said, "but there's a but. If you
give it you must endow it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Jane's
uncle.</p>

<p>"The camera's the least part of it,"
I replied. "For half-a-guinea you can
cast a camera upon the world, but have
you given a moment's consideration to
that camera's means of support? No,
I thought not. One more proof of the
happy-go-lucky spirit of the present
day. Yet you know that a camera has
to be fed on plates, that it consumes
quantities of poisonous acids, and expresses
itself on reams of paper. It is
altogether a desperate and spendthrift
character. On whom do you suppose
the cost of all this will fall?"</p>

<p>"On the employer, I should think,"
said Jane's uncle. "Doesn't Jane get
pocket-money?"</p>

<p>"Threepence a week," I said. "Barely
her share of the camera's insurance
stamp. Jane being under age, any
debts she may incur will devolve on
me, and I am really not in a position
to take on this responsibility. No, I
repeat, if you give it you must endow
it."</p>

<p>Jane's uncle meditated. Then he
said, "Very well, I'll endow it to the
extent of &pound;1 a year, to be paid in quarterly
instalments of 5s. each."</p>

<p>Jane was delighted with the scheme.
She had never had five shillings to
spend before, and was enthralled to find
that it would buy not only paper and
poisons and plates, but also a mackintosh
coat for her camera. Then she took
snapshots indoors and outdoors, at all
times and in all weathers, with catholic
indifference to subject and suitability.</p>

<p>"The book says one has to learn by
experience," she said, showing me a
pile of under-exposures. "This one of
you is very good&mdash;the only pity is that
I didn't get your head into the photo."
This was one of many small details.</p>

<p>Jane looked forward feverishly to the
payment of the second instalment.</p>

<p>"You'll have to put it by," I said.
"You have plenty of paper and things
left, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I want a dormouse."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that wouldn't be legal," I
said. "That would be a misappropriation
of trust funds."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Jane.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "don't you see that the
money's given to endow your camera,
and must be spent on that camera and
nothing else?"</p>

<p>"But there's nothing more to get
for it," urged Jane.</p>

<p>"Then the money must accumulate
interest until there is," I said.</p>

<p>Women have no heads for the law.
I could not make Jane see that to buy
a dormouse with the funds of the
camera would be an irregular and
punishable proceeding. Finally, in
despair, I had to promise to ask her
uncle if he would recognise the application
of one quarter's payment to
the purchase of a dormouse. He acceded
to the somewhat unusual request
with his customary good-nature.</p>

<p>"But remember," I told Jane, "the
next instalment must be spent on the
camera."</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, however, the
camera fell into disuse. I was asked
more rarely, and more rarely still, to
look through prints. At last I was
asked no more.</p>

<p>Then the third instalment arrived.</p>

<p>"You want some more paper and
things by now, I suppose?" I said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"The light hasn't been good lately,"
said Jane evasively. "I've not been
taking many photos."</p>

<p>"Then what are you going to do
with the money?"</p>

<p>"Ask Uncle if I may buy a stamp-album."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Shortly after this, Jane's uncle's birthday
came round. I passed a shop in
the City which had recently had a fire.
Five hundred silver cigarette-cases had
been pluckily rescued from the flames
and, to celebrate their escape, were being
offered for sale at a remarkably low
figure. One of these survivors was dispatched
to Jane's uncle.</p>

<p>He dined with us the next evening,
and was more grateful than I could
reasonably expect. He handled the
cigarette-case quite fondly.</p>

<p>"But what about its endowment?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I said.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't a cigarette-case as eligible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
as a camera?" he said. "Its needs are,
I consider, even greater. Presumably
this gift is meant to facilitate my
smoking, but an empty cigarette-case
offers me nothing to smoke&mdash;it implies
the heavy responsibility on an already
overburdened man of keeping it filled.
Now, suppose you complete the gift,
as I did Jane's, by at least a year's
endowment?"</p>

<p>I began to wish that the cigarette-cases
had perished, but after his kindness
to Jane I could hardly refuse.</p>

<p>"Well, what would it cost?" I said.</p>

<p>"That's easily reckoned," said Jane's
uncle. "Say I smoke on an average
fifteen cigarettes a day&mdash;that's 105 a
week&mdash;that's&mdash;&mdash; Have you a piece of
paper?"</p>

<p>It worked out at just under 5,500
cigarettes a year. At 8<i>s.</i> a hundred,
twenty guineas would just cover the
year's endowment. It seemed out of
all proportion to the cost of the case.</p>

<p>"It's a good deal more than Jane's
camera got," I protested.</p>

<p>"I told you its claims were greater.
Of course you can't expect to get off
as cheaply with a fixed habit of maturity
as with the passing caprice of a
kid. On the other hand you might
have done worse. Suppose you had
given me golf-clubs&mdash;there'd have been
golf-balls, caddies, club subscription,
lunches, fares and postage on correspondence
with <i>The Times</i>. Compared
with that, what is a paltry five guineas
a quarter?"</p>

<p>On reflection I found that very few
presents would have escaped the endowment
scheme altogether, and that
the cigarette-case was really a comparatively
modest pensioner, and I felt
a little comforted.</p>

<p>For four quarters I remitted five
guineas to Jane's uncle.</p>

<p>My present seemed to change his
nature. Whereas he had been a man
rather to ignore the claims of clothes
than to consider them, I now noticed
that he looked more prosperous and
was better dressed than I had ever seen
him before. Once, when he appeared in
a new lounge suit&mdash;the second new one
within my knowledge in six months&mdash;I
could not refrain from remarking
on it.</p>

<p>"One has to dress up to a silver
cigarette-case, old fellow," he said, and
the subject was dismissed.</p>

<p>The year was on the point of expiring.
One day I was talking with Jane's
uncle and another man at the Club.
The other man offered me a cigarette,
and to my amazement passed Jane's
uncle over with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No good offering you one, I know,
poor old chap. When is your doctor
going to give you a reprieve?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said sadly, taking
a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" I said
when we were alone. "What about
the endowment at the rate of fifteen
cigarettes a day?"</p>

<p>"A parallel case to Jane's," he answered.
"There seems something fatal
about these endowments. Three days
after you had agreed to endow the
cigarette-case my doctor forbade me, on
pain of some awful 'itis,' to exceed
three cigarettes a day. With the first
instalment you had provided me with
cigarettes for the year. So what should
I do in these circumstances but follow
the precedent set by your family?
Only, instead of a dormouse and a
stamp-album, I chose to purchase
smartness. I spent the three remaining
instalments on my wardrobe."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was my birthday yesterday. Jane's
uncle sent me a handsome silver-mounted
walking-stick. "It is the only
thing I can think of that requires no
endowment," he wrote. "Pavements
are supplied by the County Council,
and you have an umbrella-stand."</p>

<p>I should like to use it across his back.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S HOLIDAY STORIES.</h2>

<center>IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">In the Highland Forests.</span></center>

<center>(<i>In the approved manner of the Sporting Feuilleton.</i>)</center>

<p>Alone in a first-class compartment
of the Scotch Express Ralph Wonderson,
athlete and sportsman, journeyed
northwards for the grouse hunting.
He was surrounded by gun-cases and
cartridge-belts, and, as the train flashed
through the summer landscape, he reflected
pleasantly that "Grey Bob,"
his magnificent hunter, was snugly
ensconced in the horse-box adjoining.</p>

<p>It was dusk when they arrived at the
little Highland station. As he stepped
out of the carriage with jingling
spurs he was greeted
by Grey Bob, who stood impatiently
pawing the platform.
Flicking a speck of
dust from his favourite's
glossy neck, Ralph leaped
lightly into the saddle and
cantered out of the station
towards Clancrachan Castle.</p>

<p>As he rode through the
gathering darkness he caracoled
with an enviable lightness
of heart. Was not his
host for the next three weeks
his bosom-friend, young Lord
Tamerton? And was not
the beautiful golden-haired
Lady Margaret Tamerton
with her brother? Little
marvel that Ralph tossed
his rifle high in the air and
caught it again and again
from sheer exuberance of
spirits.</p>

<p>When he reached the
ancient castle he found dinner
over and the guests,
among whom were some of
the keenest sportsmen in
Britain, assembled in the
gun-room.</p>

<p>"In the nick of time, Ralph!" exclaimed
Lord Tamerton, clasping his
hand warmly. "We are trying to
create a medi&aelig;val atmosphere in keeping
with our surroundings, and as host
I was about to announce in the approved
manner of Chivalry that the
Champion of to-morrow's hunt shall be
rewarded with the hand of my only
sister, Lady Margaret. It is for you to
do your <i>devoir</i> like a <i>preux chevalier</i>."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughter and
applause. Only Ralph remained serious.
His fingers tightening on those of Lady
Margaret, he plunged his eyes earnestly
into hers. Doubtless he read there
what he had hoped to see.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was a merry party which set out
next morning, and, as each cavalier
passed Lady Margaret, who stood on
the terrace, he playfully pledged himself
to do his knightliest.</p>

<p>Soon they parted, each taking his
own route. Ralph, urging Grey Bob
to his best paces, plunged straight into
the heart of the forest, his loader
running sturdily at his stirrup. A
curious, taciturn fellow, this loader,
with a tangled mass of flaming red
hair and a bushy red beard which
almost obscured his features and hung
below his sporran.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%">
<a href="images/228.png">
<img src="images/228.png" width="100%" alt="THROUGH GERMAN SPECTACLES" /></a><br /><br />
<p>THROUGH GERMAN SPECTACLES.</p><br />
<p><i>Germany.</i> "<span class="sc">Permit me to recommend these glasses, made in
Germany, and guaranteed to give an unusually wide and
luminous view&mdash;same, in fact, as mine.</span>"</p>
<p><i>Italy</i>. "<span class="sc">Very kind and thoughtful, I'm sure; but I can see
quite nicely, thank you. I can see right through you, for
instance, with the naked eye. <i>Good</i> morning.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Arrived at what appeared a suitable
spot, Ralph tethered Grey Bob to a
sapling and took up his position behind
a massive oak. He was extracting the
field-glasses from the case at his side
when his pulses contracted as he felt
a cold rim of metal pressed suddenly
against the back of his neck. In a
flash he realised that it was the muzzle
of a rifle. There was a grim, tense
silence for a full minute.</p>

<p>"Take these," said the cold, drawling
voice of the loader, "and write as I
dictate."</p>

<p>Ralph took the paper and fountain-pen
which were thrust over his shoulder
and prepared to write.</p>

<p>"Commence," continued the voice.
"<i>I&mdash;Ralph Wonderson&mdash;hereby confess&mdash;that
I poisoned&mdash;the late Lord
Tamerton.&mdash;I also hereby renounce&mdash;all
pretensions&mdash;to the hand&mdash;of Lady
Margaret Tamerton.</i> Now sign it."</p>

<p>In obedience to a further command
Ralph handed back the sheet. He
could not forbear a grim smile as he
did so. He had written the single word,
"<i>Rats!</i>"</p>

<p>It was received with a loud exclamation
of protest. Ralph ducked and turned
in one catlike movement and hurled
himself upon the loader. The rifle flew
away, discharging itself uselessly into
the branches of the oak. Clasping his
adversary by the throat Ralph pushed
him backwards to the ground, and the
pair rolled over locked in a deadly
embrace. Then suddenly the loader
relaxed his grip and lay limp and still.</p>

<p>Breathing heavily, Ralph raised
himself to his knees and pulled away
the false wig and beard of his prostrate
foe. Not altogether to his
surprise he beheld the features
of Sir Ernest Scrivener,
<i>alias</i> Marmaduke Moorsdyke.</p>

<p>A low gasp of relief made
him glance up. Seated on
her black palfrey was Lady
Margaret, who had been
watching the struggle with
breathless and agonised
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Madge!" cried Ralph,
rising to his feet. "What
are you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her quick cry of warning
came too late. Wheeling
round, Ralph found that
the treacherous baronet had
seized a second rifle and had
levelled it directly at Lady
Margaret's heart.</p>

<p>"I rather think," said the
slow, sneering voice, "that
I am now in a position to
enforce my commands. You
will walk steadily backwards
for two miles. If you refuse
I shall shoot Lady Margaret.
And I shall shoot to kill."</p>

<p>His nerves as steady as
steel in this desperate crisis,
Ralph swiftly analysed the situation.
If he backed away as commanded,
Sir Ernest would then mount Grey
Bob and ride off with Lady Margaret,
and Ralph realised that even
her death was preferable to this. If
he made a dash at the assailant,
the latter, to save his own skin,
would almost certainly fire. But Ralph
knew that Sir Ernest, in spite of his
threat, had no intention of shooting
Lady Margaret if it could possibly be
avoided.</p>

<p>He determined to remain perfectly
still. The probabilities were that Scrivener,
realising he had been outwitted,
would sooner or later turn his rifle suddenly
on Ralph, and Ralph, in all the
pride of his magnificent physical powers,
knew that in that brief moment he could
hurl himself upon the other.</p>

<p>But Sir Ernest knew it also.</p>

<p>Ralph stood motionless. Lady Margaret,
playing her part bravely, sat
motionless on her palfrey. Sir Ernest
lay motionless, his rifle pointed inflexibly
at her heart. No word was
spoken.</p>

<p>A grouse in the oak-tree croaked
jeeringly.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An hour passed. Two hours. Three.
Four. There was not the tremor of a
muscle among the three.</p>

<p>Five hours passed. Six. Seven.
Then Ralph felt that the strain could
be borne no longer. He resolved to
count a hundred and at the end of that
time to rush desperately forward, hoping
against hope that the murderous bullet
would not find its billet.</p>

<p><i>Ninety-seven ... ninety-eight ...
ninety-nine</i> ... Ralph caught his
breath sharply. The finger on the rifle
trigger had relaxed.</p>

<p>Sir Ernest had fainted.</p>

<p>In thirty seconds Ralph had bound
him hand and foot. With a long,
quivering sigh of relief Lady Margaret
slid from her horse and threw herself
into her rescuer's arms. Ralph crushed
her to his breast in a passion of
gratitude.</p>

<p>But Lady Margaret quickly disengaged
herself. "What about the grouse?"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" exclaimed Ralph,
snatching out his watch. "It's four
o'clock! I have only one hour, and
the others will have had eight."</p>

<p>He seized his field-glasses, sprang
into the oak and swept the surrounding
country. There was not a grouse in
sight. He gave vent to an exclamation
of despair.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" said Lady Margaret.
"I know their sanctuary. You can do
it yet."</p>

<p>Snatching up the rifles, Ralph followed
the girl as she threaded her way
through the trees. At last she halted
abruptly. "Look!" she whispered.
"There they are."</p>

<p>And, indeed, Ralph saw that all the
trees around him were congested with
grouse. He levelled his rifle and fired.</p>

<p>Bang! A grouse fell at his feet. He
snatched the second rifle from Lady
Margaret, who had assumed the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
loader. Bang! Another fell. There
was no escape from that deadly eye.</p>

<p>Lady Margaret had been brought up
to sport from her earliest youth. As a
child she had watched many of the
finest shots in Europe. But she had
never seen anything like this. Such
unerring precision enthralled her.</p>

<p>And she played her own part nobly.
Almost before Ralph had surrendered
the empty rifle the loaded one was in
his grasp. And when the barrels grew
red-hot, her quick wit saved the situation
and she thrust them into the
stream which trickled at their feet.</p>

<p>Bang!... Bang!... Bang!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Again the guests were assembled in
the gun-room.</p>

<p>"Oyez! Oyez!" cried Lord Tamerton
merrily. "I proclaim the champion
to be Ralph Wonderson, with a total
bag of two thousand brace."</p>

<p>Amid a clamour of laughter and congratulation
Lady Margaret came shyly
forward and laid her left hand on
Ralph's shoulder.</p>

<p>On its third finger glittered a magnificent
hoop of diamonds.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST BLUNDER.</h2>

<p>How I succeeded in getting this
interview I should very much like to
know. But I did. Let that suffice.</p>

<p>When I entered He was standing
before His mirror fumbling with His
moustache, which seemed unwilling any
more to point upwards, but had a
persistent droop. "<i>Donner und blitzen!</i>"
He exclaimed irascibly as he
added more and more stiffening paste.</p>

<p>Observing me He paused and sat
down, motioning me to do the same.
Then, after taking a tablespoonful of
the blood-and-iron tonic in a bottle
beside Him, He bade me be quick with
my questions as He was busy.</p>

<p>I explained my visit at once. "It
says in the paper," I said, "that your
Majesty's troops are being
withdrawn from the North of
Belgium."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And that," I continued,
"the province of Antwerp is
free of them."</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>"But," I said, "surely
that is a mistake&mdash;an error
both of tactics and judgment
of the greatest seriousness?"</p>

<p>"How?" He asked.</p>

<p>"This chastisement of the
world," I said, "which you
are to inflict&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled agreement.</p>

<p>"This spread of <i>Geist</i>&mdash;"
I continued.</p>

<p>He beamed.</p>

<p>"How can it be thorough
if you shirk your duty?" I
added.</p>

<p>He bade me explain myself
more fully.</p>

<p>"Take Louvain," I said, "as a start.
That was splendid."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it?" He replied. "Hoch!"</p>

<p>"That's the way," I continued.
"Destroy the gems of architecture.
Burn the priceless and unique manuscripts.
Wreck the seats of learning.
That will teach the world what you
really mean, what you really stand for."</p>

<p>His eyes glistened. "We do our
best," He said. "Hoch!"</p>

<p>"But why be half-hearted?" I went
on. "That's the folly. It seems to
me that some one among your generals
must be blundering very badly if
Antwerp is to be so scandalously
neglected. The lesson that it might
teach if properly handled! The enormous
value of its example to those
parts of the civilised world that are still
on the fence!&mdash;Holland, for instance,
Italy, Bulgaria."</p>

<p>"But the blunder? For God's sake&mdash;I
should say for My sake&mdash;tell Me
quickly," He said with his hand on the
telephone.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">

<p><i>Turkey.</i> "<span class="sc">Looks very tempting and fruity; but what I want
to know is, who's going to pay the doctor's bill if complications
ensue?</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>I drew from my pocket a packet
of picture postcards and showed him
one.</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" He said. "Where
is it?"</p>

<p>"Antwerp Cathedral," I replied.</p>

<p>"What a lovely spire!" He remarked
wistfully. "So tall and slender. It
looks as if it would fall so easily."</p>

<p>I showed Him another.</p>

<p>"That is charming," He said. "Where
is that?"</p>

<p>"Antwerp again," I said. "The
Plantin museum. The most interesting
printing establishment in the world.
So quiet, so serene&mdash;in short, perfect
and irreplaceable."</p>

<p>The last word seemed to strike Him.</p>

<p>He repeated it once or twice.</p>

<p>"And these are at Antwerp?" He
asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "And these"&mdash;showing
Him more photographs&mdash;"are at
Bruges. And," I added meaningly,
"still standing."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right," He exclaimed.
"It is outrageous. What fool ordered
the withdrawal from Belgium, I wonder&mdash;with
all this work for culture still
to do!"</p>

<p>He was furious.</p>

<p>"Not a stone should have been left,"
He said. "The true <i>Geist</i> must prevail.
Every opportunity of proving
our enlightenment should have been
taken. There will be trouble over this,
I can promise you. Leave me now. I
must think."</p>

<p>He turned again to the blood-and-iron
tonic, and was once more at the
mirror when I left. His moustaches
had come undone again. Both ends
now pointed resolutely to the carpet.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE COUNTING OF CHICKENS.</h2>

<p>FOR business reasons I had to take
my holiday alone this year, after my
wife and children had come back from
Cornwall.</p>

<p>While I was away Peggy wrote to
me and said that Evangeline, her
favourite Minorca, had laid eleven eggs.
Whereupon she, Evangeline, had become
broody and refused to be comforted;
so Peggy said she had added
two eggs that Clara, one of the Cochins,
had laid and was saving up, and
put them under Evangeline, who had
sat on the lot for the regulation
period, the result being ten of the
dearest little fluffy chickens you ever
saw. My first reflection was that there
they were, ten of them, eating the bread
of idleness, and in war-time,
I too, with so many other more
useful mouths to fill.</p>

<p>But Peggy's last paragraph
was consoling. She informed
her father that she intended
to collar some of the alien
trade, and had made a good
start with her ten chickens,
in addition to the three
Minorcas, five Cochins, and
two Pedigree-unknowns,
which were all laying eggs
like anything. Another of
the Cochins, Maud Eliza, was
beginning to get broody, and
was being trained for her
sitting Marathon on a box
of my best golf-balls, and
altogether things looked rosy&mdash;from
Peggy's point of view.</p>

<p>I replied by return of post
that she was really trying to
ruin a neutral Denmark, and
that to compete with the hated foe
she must induce Evangeline, Clara &amp; Co.
to turn their attention to laying
sausages, the brass collars of electric-light
bulbs, toys and small hardware;
but, so as not to discourage her, I
added that the chickens would make
splendid table-decorations later on, and
would keep down Williamson's absurd
bills for meat.</p>

<p>I came home yesterday; and after
tea Peggy presented me with a sheet of
paper covered with figures&mdash;a set of
multiplication sums in fact. There was
a column for each of the hens and their
possible offsprings, and the grand total,
expressed in terms of chickens, was
stupendous.</p>

<p>"What," she said, "is a chicken
worth when it's ready to cook?"</p>

<p>"It depends," I said, "whether you
are buying or selling it."</p>

<p>"Selling," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh; say 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>"Then to be on the safe side," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
said, "we'll call it 2<i>s.</i> That makes
twice 1,121 shillings. How much is
that?"</p>

<p>I found a stump of pencil, and an
empty corner of <i>The History of the War</i>,
and worked it out. "&pound;112 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>," I
said at last.</p>

<p>"Not so bad, Daddy, in twelve
months."</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" I said; "colossal!
But you haven't allowed for the
chickens we shall eat."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "but we shall save
2<i>s.</i> on each one we eat, so it's the same
thing in the end."</p>

<p>I admitted the plausibility of this
calculation.</p>

<p>"But," I said, "you're not allowing
for deaths and bad eggs."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am," she said; "I've
only allowed half the eggs to become
chickens."</p>

<p>"You'd never make a company promoter,"
I said.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be a hospital nurse,
thank you, Daddy," she said with her
nose in the air. "Do come and see
Evangeline's family."</p>

<p>So we strolled into the garden and
down to the poultry run, taking the
multiplication sums with us.</p>

<p>Evangeline, the optimist, was busy
scratching up the more or less kindly
fruits of the earth for her family and
didn't make the slightest sign of
recognition, though I coughed twice.</p>

<p>"She's much too busy," said Peggy,
"to notice that you've come home.
Aren't they darlings?"</p>

<p>"They're certainly a healthy-looking
lot. Two of them I recognise as Clara's
contribution. Doesn't she mind?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Peggy;
"she's busy too. She's been sitting
now for nearly a fortnight, and Maud
Eliza's on eggs as well."</p>

<p>"I hope none of my golf balls are
addled," I said. "I want to have a
round to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I've washed them
all and put them back again."</p>

<p>"Good egg!" I said.</p>

<p>Suddenly I had an unhappy thought.
"Where," I asked, "are the figures
relating to this lot of Evangeline's?"</p>

<p>"Here," she said, "under 'E'. Five
chickens. I've allowed five to die,
though I'm sure they wouldn't if they
knew what they're wanted for."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to work it
all out again."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "five chickens,
and each going to lay at least enough
eggs to sit on, and half of the sitting to
mature, as it were; that sounds fair
enough, but not more than three of
this lot will lay eggs at all."</p>

<p>"Oh! why ever not?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nature's limitations," I explained.
"Seven of them are cockerels."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</center>

<p>Some people have all the luck! Fancy preparing for
publication this summer a novel whose scene is laid in
Belgium. The picture of Bruges Tower on the cover of
<i>The Belfry</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) should alone be
enough to sell it like the hottest of hot cakes. Of course
it would be rather too much to expect the story to treat
of the Belgium we all love and admire to-day. Indeed,
<span class="sc">Margaret Baillie Saunders</span>, writing in the old times of
six weeks ago, permits herself some good-natured humour
at the expense of the little red-trousered army. To-day it
sounds oddly archaic. But, this apart, there is enough
topical and local colour in the setting to secure success,
even without an interesting story such as is told here. One
may perhaps fairly easily detect its inspiration in certain
actual happenings. It is the story of a woman, <i>Lucy
Briarwell</i>, clever and gifted with personality, the grass-widow
of an apparently incurable
lunatic who, living
in Bruges, falls under the
influence of a Belgian poet-dramatist.
Together&mdash;for
<i>Lucy</i> is shown as his collaborator
and source of inspiration&mdash;they
evolve a wonderful
new form of miracle
play in which she presently
captivates London and Paris
as the reincarnate <i>Notre
Dame de Bruges</i>. So much
of the tale I indicate; the
rest is your affair. It is
told in a pleasant haphazard
fashion, enriched with
flashes of caustic wit and
disfigured with a good deal
of ungrammatical and
slovenly writing. I think I
never met a novelist who
did more execution among
the infinitives. Also I suspect
that Mrs. <span class="sc">Saunders'</span>
zeal for theatrical setting
outran her knowledge of it, otherwise she would hardly
have permitted a dramatist to speak of his "caste," or the
leading lady to leave the theatre (even under circumstances
of faintness) in her stage costume. But for all that my
congratulations to her on a good story.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>My impression of <i>Behind the Picture</i> (<span class="sc">Ward, Lock</span>) is
that it would be better worth reading if it contained less of
the tale&mdash;which, to speak quite candidly, is parlous nonsense&mdash;and
more of the trimmings. The trimmings are
mostly concerned with art bargain-hunting, and are excellent
fun. Most of us have the treasure-trove instinct
sufficiently developed to like reading about a young man
who picks up Gainsboroughs for a tenner, or unearths lost
masterpieces of <span class="sc">Turner</span> on a clue supplied by an old letter.
The young man in question was <i>Hugh Limner</i>, and in his
off moments he fulfilled perfunctorily the duties of hero of
the story. But I can't help thinking that Mr. M. <span class="sc">McD.
Bodkin</span>, his creator, liked him best as an expert. Certainly
I myself did. <i>Hugh</i>, as I say, found his buried
Turner on the authority of an autograph letter from the
artist, which in its turn he had found in a volume entitled
"Turner's Poems," that proved to have belonged to
<span class="sc">Ruskin</span>, the whole purchased off a stall for ten shillings.
That was the kind of expert <i>Hugh</i> was. When he had dug
up the picture he exhibited it in a private gallery, where
"each day an eager crowd freely paid an entrance-fee of
half-a-guinea." How, when he could achieve that kind of
luck, could he be expected to take more than a languid
interest in a tale where the most impossible people behave
most impossibly; where, for example, a missing peer posts
a letter to his wife at the back of a picture-frame for no
earthly reason; where the villain, younger brother of the
long-lost, comes into the heroine's drawing-room and says,
"You must allow me to introduce myself. I am Frederick
Ackland, Earl of Sternholt"? We were only beginning
the second chapter, but my wonder is that a fellow like
<i>Hugh</i>, who was within hearing, didn't throw up his part at
once. He would have had my sympathy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The public is quite content to have any amount of trite
philosophy passed off upon it as new goods by the author
who has a gift for dialect and uses an American negro as
mouthpiece. Miss <span class="sc">Dorothy
Dix</span> employs a black laundress of
the name of <i>Mirandy</i>
(<span class="sc">Sampson Low</span>) for philosopher;
and cheerfully persisting
with the "yessum's,"
the "wid's," the "dat's" and
the "becaze's," tells us with
incessant humour many
things we all knew before
about husbands, their little
idiosyncracies and weaknesses
and the methods by
which they may be best
caught and trained for their
purpose in life. Now and
then <i>Mirandy</i> gets away
from matters matrimonial,
and it is upon these too rare
occasions that she is at her
best. I was particularly
moved by her views on the
just rights of the invalid,
summed up in the urgent
demand that those on the
sick-bed should (omitting
the lingo) "be allowed to enjoy being ill in their own way,
without being persecuted by their friends and their friends'
doctors, pet remedies and religions." On the whole, I
may quite safely recommend these two hundred and fifty
pleasantly written and delightfully printed pages to readers
who like to muse quietly on the elementary principles of
love and life without risking the surprise of startling or
revolutionary lines of thought. There is nothing peculiarly
good or bad in the many comic illustrations by
Mr. <span class="sc">E. W. Kemble</span>.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> regrets that in his last week's notice of
<span class="sc">Marie Van Vorst's</span> delightful romance, <i>His Love Story</i>, he
spoiled her good Dutch name by calling her Marie Von
Vorst. He offers his best apologies.</p>
